~ vs laravel
manage.py = artisan
confusing
    multiple packages e.g. mysite and polls (an app) that need to work with each other
stupid
    stick to industry naming e.g. routes, not urls
    multiple urls.py per package
    env not standard
        https://djangostars.com/blog/configuring-django-settings-best-practices/
    no urls.py generated for polls app (python manage.py startapp polls)
    naming conventions to determine parent child
        Laravel has many etc. is much better
    table names not plural
    laravel scopes are better than django filters

great
    groups and permissions are standard
    models need to be verbose
        alterations are automatically generated
    package prefix on tables
    model to string based on a specific field is neat
